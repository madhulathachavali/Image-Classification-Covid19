# Image Classification-Covid19

The dataset comprises a training set and a test set of images belonging to 3 classes: COVID-19, Viral Pneumonia, and Normal. Each image is identified by a unique filename. The objective of the project is to develop a classifier capable of predicting the class of X-ray images. A CNN classifier was employed, which achieved 92% accuracy (0.2 loss) on the training data and 82% accuracy (0.4 loss) on the test data.
